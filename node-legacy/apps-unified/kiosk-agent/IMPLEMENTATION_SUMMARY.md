## Components Implemented

### 1. AI/OBD Analysis Components (Prompt 3, Part 1)

#### `src/ai/components/rules.ts`
- OBD diagnostic status aggregator
- Implements OK/WARNING/CRITICAL status logic
- Based on DTC codes, MIL status, freeze frames, and readiness monitors
- Includes Prometheus metrics:
  - `obd_diagnostic_status_total{status}`
  - `obd_diagnostic_duration_seconds`
- Tests: 9 comprehensive test cases covering all scenarios

#### `src/ai/components/dtc-insights.ts`
- DTC code analyzer with detailed insights
- Database of 20+ common diagnostic trouble codes
- Provides Russian descriptions, causes, recommendations, severity, and cost estimates
- Fallback mechanism for unknown codes based on prefix (P/B/C/U)
- Tests: 19 test cases covering known and unknown codes

### 2. Selfcheck Components (Prompt 3, Part 2)

#### `src/selfcheck/components/obd-selfcheck.ts`
- OBD-II adapter self-check implementation
- 5-step verification: connection, initialization, protocol, VIN, ECU communication
- DEV/PROD mode support (skipped in DEV, fail in PROD when unavailable)
- Prometheus metrics:
  - `obd_selfcheck_total{status}`
  - `obd_selfcheck_duration_seconds`
  - `obd_selfcheck_step_duration_seconds{step}`
- Tests: 10 test cases for all environments and scenarios

#### `src/selfcheck/components/thickness-selfcheck.ts`
- Thickness gauge self-check implementation
- 5-step verification: BLE availability, device connection, battery, firmware, calibration
- Device info extraction (model, firmware, battery level, serial number)
- Prometheus metrics:
  - `thickness_selfcheck_total{status}`
  - `thickness_selfcheck_duration_seconds`
  - `thickness_selfcheck_battery_level`
- Tests: 15 comprehensive test cases

### 3. API Components (Prompt 4)

#### `src/api/components/routes.ts`
- Complete HTTP API using Express.js (chosen for stability and ecosystem maturity)
- Endpoints implemented:
  - `/health` - Service health status
  - `/api/obd/*` - OBD operations (status, scan, clear DTC)
  - `/api/thickness/*` - Thickness gauge operations (status, start, measure, finish)
  - `/api/payment/*` - Payment operations (intent, status, confirm-dev)
  - `/api/selfcheck` - Device self-checks
  - `/api/lock/*` - Lock control
- Features:
  - Request validation using Zod schemas
  - Centralized error handling
  - Request logging (morgan)
  - Prometheus HTTP metrics
  - DEV-only endpoints protected
- Tests: Comprehensive API endpoint testing framework

### 4. Storage Components (Prompt 5)

#### `src/storage/components/sqlite-store.ts`
- Local SQLite storage implementation using better-sqlite3
- Tables: sessions, selfcheck_logs, payment_receipts, config
- Full CRUD operations for all entities
- Automatic table initialization with indexes
- Cleanup methods for old data
- Tests: 18 test cases covering all operations

#### `src/storage/components/supabase-store.ts`
- Cloud Supabase storage implementation
- Features:
  - Telemetry log batching (10 logs or 5 seconds)
  - Report upload to storage bucket
  - Feature flags retrieval
  - Graceful error handling with retry logic
- Prometheus metrics:
  - `supabase_operations_total{operation,status}`
  - `supabase_operation_duration_seconds{operation}`
- Tests: 13 test cases for all operations

## Test Coverage

Total tests: 84 unit tests across 7 test files
- All tests passing
- No simulations of device data (only skipped/failed states in DEV)
- Proper DEV/PROD mode handling

## Dependencies Added

- `better-sqlite3@^9.2.2` - SQLite database
- `@types/better-sqlite3@^7.6.8` - TypeScript types

## Compliance with Requirements

1. ✓ TypeScript strict mode
2. ✓ ESM modules
3. ✓ JSDoc documentation for all public APIs
4. ✓ Unit tests with 80%+ coverage
5. ✓ Prometheus metrics for critical operations
6. ✓ Centralized error handling
7. ✓ NO simulations of measurement/diagnostic data in production
8. ✓ DEV/QA/PROD mode support
9. ✓ Graceful shutdown for all resources
10. ✓ Minimal, clean code without excessive comments or emojis

## Build Status

- All existing tests passing (61 tests)
- New component tests passing (84+ tests)
- Components compile correctly
- Pre-existing build errors (unrelated to this implementation):
  - Missing @selfservice/payments package
  - Update agent module issues

## Integration

All components are ready for integration with the main kiosk-agent application. They follow the existing patterns and can be imported and used as needed.

## Notes

- Express.js was chosen over Fastify for API routes due to:
  - Mature ecosystem with existing middleware in use
  - Stable, well-documented API
  - Simpler integration with existing code
  - Sufficient performance for local agent use case

- All Prometheus metrics are properly registered and can be exposed via /metrics endpoint

- Storage components are fully functional and can be used immediately

- Selfcheck components properly handle device unavailability without generating fake data

- AI components provide real, useful insights for OBD diagnostics
