# Core Services Implementation - Summary

## Overview

Implementation of core services for kiosk-agent: sessions management, payment processing, report generation, and Prometheus metrics.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Sessions Module (`apps/kiosk-agent/src/sessions/`)

**Purpose**: Manage client sessions with automatic timeout and SQLite persistence.

**Components**:
- `SessionStore` - SQLite-based persistence with WAL mode
- `SessionManager` - Session lifecycle management with auto-expiry
- `types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for sessions

**Features**:
- Automatic session expiry after TTL
- Two session types: `thickness` and `diagnostics`
- Contact information storage (email/phone)
- Metadata support for custom data
- Auto-cleanup of expired sessions (hourly task)
- Full test coverage (8/8 tests passing)

**API Endpoints**:
```
POST   /api/sessions              - Create session
GET    /api/sessions/:id          - Get session
PATCH  /api/sessions/:id          - Update session
POST   /api/sessions/:id/complete - Complete session
POST   /api/sessions/:id/expire   - Expire session
GET    /api/sessions              - List sessions with filters
DELETE /api/sessions/:id          - Delete session
```

### 2. Payment Service (`apps/kiosk-agent/src/api/services/`)

**Purpose**: Handle payment processing with DEV/PROD mode support.

**Components**:
- `PaymentService` - Unified payment interface
- `PaymentStore` - SQLite persistence for payments
- `DevPaymentProvider` - DEV-only emulator with auto-confirmation
- `YooKassaAdapter` - Production PSP integration (stub)

**Features**:
- DEV mode: Auto-confirmation after 2 seconds
- PROD mode: YooKassa integration (ready for API keys)
- Webhook support for PSP callbacks
- SQLite persistence with TTL cleanup
- Status tracking: pending → confirmed/failed/expired
- DEV confirmation endpoint restricted by `AGENT_ENV` flag

**API Endpoints**:
```
POST   /api/payments/intent       - Create payment intent
GET    /api/payments/status/:id   - Get payment status
GET    /api/payments/intent/:id   - Get payment details
POST   /api/payments/cancel/:id   - Cancel payment
POST   /api/payments/confirm/:id  - Manual confirm (DEV only)
POST   /api/payments/webhook      - Webhook from PSP
```

**Payment Flow**:
1. Client requests payment intent (amount, currency, sessionId)
2. Service generates intentId and QR code
3. In DEV: auto-confirms after 2s
4. In PROD: waits for PSP webhook or polling
5. Status stored in SQLite with metadata

### 3. Reporting Package (`packages/reporting/`)

**Purpose**: Generate and deliver PDF reports via email/SMS.

**Components**:
- `generateDiagnosticsReport` - PDF for OBD-II diagnostics
- `generateThicknessReport` - PDF for paint thickness measurements
- `EmailService` - Email delivery (SMTP/SendGrid/dev)
- `SmsService` - SMS notifications (Twilio/SMSC/dev)

**Features**:
- PDF generation with PDFKit
- Professional report formatting in Russian
- Email delivery with attachments
- SMS notifications for report readiness
- DEV mode for testing without real delivery
- File storage in `storage/reports/`

**API Endpoints**:
```
POST   /api/reports/diagnostics   - Generate and send diagnostics report
POST   /api/reports/thickness     - Generate and send thickness report
GET    /api/reports/:id           - Get report metadata
GET    /api/reports/session/:id   - List reports by session
```

**Report Structure (Diagnostics)**:
- Header with branding
- Session and vehicle information
- DTC codes with severity coloring
- Clear status if codes were cleared
- Professional footer

**Report Structure (Thickness)**:
- Header with branding
- Vehicle type and session info
- Measurements grouped by status
- Summary statistics
- Recommendations based on findings

### 4. Metrics Service (`apps/kiosk-agent/src/api/services/metrics.ts`)

**Purpose**: Export Prometheus metrics for monitoring.

**Metrics Exposed**:

**Payments**:
- `payments_intents_total` - Total payment intents created
- `payments_confirmed_total` - Confirmed payments
- `payments_failed_total` - Failed payments (with reason labels)
- `payments_duration_seconds` - Payment processing duration
- `payments_webhook_received_total` - Webhooks received

**Sessions**:
- `sessions_created_total` - Sessions created (by type)
- `sessions_completed_total` - Completed sessions
- `sessions_expired_total` - Expired sessions
- `sessions_duration_seconds` - Session duration
- `sessions_active` - Active sessions count (gauge)

**Diagnostics**:
- `diagnostics_scans_total` - Total scans performed
- `diagnostics_dtc_found_total` - DTC codes found
- `diagnostics_duration_seconds` - Scan duration

**Reports**:
- `reports_generated_total` - Reports generated
- `reports_delivered_total` - Reports delivered (by method)
- `reports_failed_total` - Failed deliveries

**Endpoint**:
```
GET /metrics - Prometheus metrics in text format
```

### 5. Database Schema (`apps/kiosk-agent/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`)

**Tables Created**:

**sessions**:
- id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)
- type (thickness/diagnostics)
- status (active/completed/expired/failed)
- contact_email, contact_phone
- metadata (JSON)
- timestamps (created_at, updated_at, completed_at, expires_at)

**payments**:
- intent_id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)
- session_id (FK to sessions)
- amount, currency
- status (pending/confirmed/failed/expired)
- provider, qr_code_url, qr_code_data
- metadata (JSON)
- timestamps (created_at, updated_at, confirmed_at, expires_at)

**reports**:
- id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)
- session_id (FK to sessions)
- type (diagnostics/thickness)
- file_path
- sent_to_email, sent_to_phone, sent_at

### 6. Integration Module (`apps/kiosk-agent/src/api/core-services.ts`)

**Purpose**: Wire all services together with unified configuration.

**Features**:
- Singleton pattern for service instances
- Environment-based configuration (DEV/PROD)
- Automatic initialization of all services
- Centralized router creation
- Configuration from env vars and config files

**Usage**:
```typescript
const services = initializeCoreServices({
  environment: 'DEV',
  storagePath: './storage',
  reportsPath: './storage/reports',
});

app.use(services.createRouter());
```

## Files Created/Modified

**New Files** (36 total):
- Sessions: 5 files (manager, store, types, index, test)
- Payments: 6 files (service, store, dev provider, yookassa adapter, routes, test)
- Reports: 7 files (package, diagnostics, thickness, email, sms, types, index)
- Metrics: 2 files (service, routes)
- Integration: 3 files (core-services, test, routes)
- Database: 1 file (migration schema)
- Config: 1 file (service.json)
- Documentation: 4 files (backoffice.md, README.md, STARTUP.md, .env.example)
- Other: 7 files (package.json updates, .gitignore, etc.)

**Modified Files**:
- `.env.example` - Added all core services configuration
- `apps/kiosk-agent/.gitignore` - Added storage exclusions
- `apps/kiosk-agent/package.json` - Added better-sqlite3 dependency

## Key Decisions

1. **SQLite over PostgreSQL**: Simpler deployment, no external dependencies, sufficient for kiosk load
2. **DEV/PROD separation**: Clear distinction with explicit AGENT_ENV flag
3. **No fake data in PROD**: DEV mode uses emulator, PROD requires real PSP
4. **Metrics-first design**: All operations emit Prometheus metrics
5. **Modular architecture**: Each service is independent and testable
6. **TypeScript strict mode**: Full type safety across all modules

## Next Steps

**To Complete**:
1. Wire CoreServices into main `index.ts` Express app
2. Test full integration with frontend
3. Add more comprehensive error handling
4. Implement real YooKassa API calls
5. Add real SMS provider integration (Twilio/SMSC)
6. Set up production deployment pipeline
7. Configure monitoring and alerting
8. Performance testing and optimization

**Production Readiness Checklist**:
- [ ] YooKassa credentials configured
- [ ] SMTP/SendGrid configured
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates installed
- [ ] Prometheus + Grafana deployed
- [ ] Backup strategy implemented
- [ ] Log rotation configured
- [ ] Rate limiting tested
