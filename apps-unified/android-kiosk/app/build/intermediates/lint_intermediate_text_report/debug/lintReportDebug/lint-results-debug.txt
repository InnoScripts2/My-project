C:\Users\Alexsey\Desktop\My project\apps-unified\android-kiosk\app\build.gradle:13: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk 34
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html
   as well as follow this guide:

C:\Users\Alexsey\Desktop\My project\apps-unified\android-kiosk\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:21: Warning: Attribute usesPermissionFlags is only used in API level 31 and higher (current min is 26) [UnusedAttribute]
        android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation" />
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedAttribute":
   This check finds attributes set in XML files that were introduced in a
   version newer than the oldest version targeted by your application (with
   the minSdkVersion attribute).

   This is not an error; the application will simply ignore the attribute.
   However, if the attribute is important to the appearance or functionality
   of your application, you should consider finding an alternative way to
   achieve the same result with only available attributes, and then you can
   optionally create a copy of the layout in a layout-vNN folder which will be
   used on API NN or higher where you can take advantage of the newer
   attribute.

   Note: This check does not only apply to attributes. For example, some tags
   can be unused too, such as the new <tag> element in layouts introduced in
   API 21.

    testImplementation 'org.mockito:mockito-core:5.12.0'
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

C:\Users\Alexsey\Desktop\My project\apps-unified\android-kiosk\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:43: Warning: Expecting android:screenOrientation="unspecified" or "fullSensor" for this activity so the user can use the application in any orientation and provide a great experience on Chrome OS devices [LockedOrientationActivity]
            android:screenOrientation="portrait">
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "LockedOrientationActivity":
   The <activity> element should not be locked to any orientation so that
   users can take advantage of the multi-window environments and larger
   screens available on Android. To fix the issue, consider declaring the
   corresponding activity element with `screenOrientation="unspecified"or
   "fullSensor"` attribute.

            android:screenOrientation="portrait">
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "DiscouragedApi":
   Discouraged APIs are allowed and are not deprecated, but they may be unfit
   for common use (e.g. due to slow performance or subtle behavior).

C:\Users\Alexsey\Desktop\My project\apps-unified\android-kiosk\app\src\main\res\xml\network_security_config.xml:6: Warning: The Network Security Configuration allows the use of user certificates in the release version of your app [AcceptsUserCertificates]
            <certificates src="user" />
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "AcceptsUserCertificates":
   Allowing user certificates could allow eavesdroppers to intercept data sent
   by your app, 'which could impact the privacy of your users. Consider
   nesting your app's trust-anchors inside a <debug-overrides> element to make
   sure they are only available when android:debuggable is set to "true".

   Explanation for issues of type "InsecureBaseConfiguration":
   Permitting cleartext traffic could allow eavesdroppers to intercept data
   sent by your app, which impacts the privacy of your users. Consider only
   allowing encrypted traffic by setting the cleartextTrafficPermitted tag to
   "false".

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

  <string name="kiosk_url_dev">http://10.0.2.2:8080/</string>
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

C:\Users\Alexsey\Desktop\My project\apps-unified\android-kiosk\app\src\main\res\mipmap-anydpi-v26\ic_launcher.xml:2: Warning: The application adaptive icon is missing a monochrome tag [MonochromeLauncherIcon]
<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
^

   Explanation for issues of type "MonochromeLauncherIcon":
   If android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in your manifest, you must
   either remove the reference to android:roundIcon if it is not needed; or,
   supply the monochrome icon in the drawable defined by the android:roundIcon
   and android:icon attribute.

   For example, if android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in the
   manifest, a launcher might choose to use android:roundIcon over
   android:icon to display the adaptive app icon. Therefore, your themed
   application iconwill not show if your monochrome attribute is not also
   specified in android:roundIcon.

C:\Users\Alexsey\Desktop\My project\apps-unified\android-kiosk\app\src\main\res\mipmap-xxxhdpi\ic_launcher.png: Warning: The ic_launcher.png icon has identical contents in the following configuration folders: mipmap-xhdpi, mipmap-xxhdpi, mipmap-xxxhdpi [IconDuplicatesConfig]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDuplicatesConfig":
   If an icon is provided under different configuration parameters such as
   drawable-hdpi or -v11, they should typically be different. This detector
   catches cases where the same icon is provided in different configuration
   folder which is usually not intentional.

C:\Users\Alexsey\Desktop\My project\apps-unified\android-kiosk\app\src\main\java\com\selfservice\kiosk\MainActivity.kt:53: Warning: Custom view `WebView` has setOnTouchListener called on it but does not override performClick [ClickableViewAccessibility]

C:\Users\Alexsey\Desktop\My project\apps-unified\android-kiosk\app\src\main\java\com\selfservice\kiosk\MainActivity.kt:53: Warning: onTouch lambda should call View#performClick when a click is detected [ClickableViewAccessibility]
        webView.setOnTouchListener { v, event ->
                                   ^

   Explanation for issues of type "ClickableViewAccessibility":
   If a View that overrides onTouchEvent or uses an OnTouchListener does not
   also implement performClick and call it when clicks are detected, the View
   may not handle accessibility actions properly. Logic handling the click
   actions should ideally be placed in View#performClick as some accessibility
   services invoke performClick when a click action should occur.
